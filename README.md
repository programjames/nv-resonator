## Theory

In [Cavity-Enhanced Microwave Readout of a Solid-State Spin Sensor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21256-7) by Dirk Englund, et al., they stack two resonators with

```
outer_radius (a) = 8.17e-3
inner_radius (b) ~ 4e-3
height       (L) = 7.26e-3
permittivity (Îµ) ~ 34
```

The readout frequency of an NV center is ~2.87 GHz, so they want to tune the cavity to have a mode ~3 GHz. Their simulation (above) assumes the two resonators are cylinders. A decent approximation for the first transverse electric mode is

$$\frac{34 (a/L + 3.45)}{a\sqrt{\epsilon}} GHz,$$

given by Kajfez & Guillon in [Dielectric resonators](https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/927557286) and readily available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_resonator#Theory_of_operation).

This approximation yields ~2.86 GHz. A numerical simulation yields 3.00 GHz. However, to place their diamond inside the cavity, they had to cut a hole through the middle. This significantly changes the available modes, as the 3.00 GHz mode has its extrema in the center.

Once the hole is accounted for, the resonance frequency doubles to ~6.44 GHz.
